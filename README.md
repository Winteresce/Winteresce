---------------
I'm Winteresce and I'm probably the cutest onee-san you will ever meet!
(why am I so flat chested though >~>)

😊 What I like:
----------------
I'm pretty passionate about the following:

```diff
  > Anime,
  > YouTube,
  > Music,
  > Gaming,
  > Creating the most useless coding scripts,
  > Japanese Culture,
  > Japan,
  > Japan,
  > and Japan
```


😴 What I am learning:
-----------------------

Currently I'm learning about how to make my scripts look more readable and how to code in different langauges, specifically improving my skills in R, Python,
and Bash. I'm also exploring the many different libraries and functions that already exist to create cool new toys that everyone can use.

I enjoy learning about how to use IDEs/IDLEs to reverse engineer naughty programs and scripts as well. 
Still waiting for Ghidra to become popular though. ^~^
I love Ubuntu and Kali.


😎 My Coding Skills:
---------------------

Anyways, I mainly create poorly formatted scripts that are absolutely horrendous to read and that output rather ugly.
However, I do most of the time create scripts that work well-ish with way too much added functionality, there's always something I later think of adding.
I'm all about automation!
